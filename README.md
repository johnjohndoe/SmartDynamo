SmartDynamo
===========

### Why


The idea is to measure the frequency from a hub dynamo to determine the speed.

With this information we can:

 a) implement a break-light 
 
 b) provide the speed-information to a smart-phone ( like a bluetooth speedometer )

### How

![circuit](images/circuit_rough_scaled.jpg)

would love to use [this minimal approach](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/131010/wheel-speed-from-shimano-dyamo-hub-using-arduino/160802#160802) ( only 2 1MOhm resistors needed ) for speed-sense - allhough I got warned by ansi that this might not work 

### Context

this is an experiment in the context of #cyclehack
